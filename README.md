# Leakage_detecction
Detecting leakage between points using 2 Hall effect waterflow sensors
###############################################################################
Components required for this project:
  1.  Arduino Uno
  2.  Generic G3/4" Thread Hall Effect Liquid Water Flow Sensor Flowmeter Fluidmeter 2-45L/min
  3.  Connecting wires
  
  Working of the project:
  Hall efect waterflow sensos are used to measure the amount of water through it, this amount is measured on the basis of the no. to times   turbine installed in the sensor ha rotated.
  Therefore if there is a leakage in the interconnected network of pipes then the rotation intensity of the turbine will change indicating   a change in quantity of water
